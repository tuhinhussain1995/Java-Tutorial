// Encapsulation Basic:

        // Bundling similar fields and methods inside a class together also helps in data hiding.

        // Data hiding can be achieved with the help of access modifiers.

                // private -----> visible from only within the class
                // protected ---> visible within the package, and among its subclasses
                // default -----> visible within the package
