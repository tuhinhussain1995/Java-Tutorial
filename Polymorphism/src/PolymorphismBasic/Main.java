// Polymorphism Basic:

        // Polymorphism means more than one form.

        // Polymorphism can be divided into two types:
                // Run-time Polymorphism ---------> Overriding
                        // When the same method is created in the superclass and its subclasses.
                        // The method that will be called during the execution of the program.
                        // In method overriding, methods should be inside different classes.

                // Compile-time Polymorphism -----> Overloading
                        // we can create methods with the same name if they differ in parameters.
                        // In method overloading, methods should be inside the same class.
