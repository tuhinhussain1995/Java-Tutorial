// For Loop:

    // Basic:
            // In computer programming, loops are used to repeat a specific block of code until a certain condition is met (test expression is false).

            // if we mistakenly set test expression in such a way that it is never false, the for loop will run forever.


    // For Loop Figure:

            // for (initialization; testExpression; update){
            //    // codes inside for loop's body
            // }

                // 1. The initialization expression is executed only once.
                // 2. Then, the test expression is evaluated. Here, test expression is a boolean expression.
                // 3. If the test expression is evaluated to true, Codes inside the body of for loop is executed. Then the update expression is executed.
                // 4. If the test expression is evaluated to false, for loop terminates.
